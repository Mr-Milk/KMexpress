clinical	<b>TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) </b> is a staging system researchers use to provide more details about how the cancer looks and behaves. The TNM system is based on three characteristics:<b>size</b> (<b>T</b> stands for tumor), <b>lymph node involvement</b> (<b>N</b> stands for node) and <b>whether the cancer has metastasized</b> (<b>M</b> stands for metastasis), or moved beyond the primary site to other parts of the body. <b>T1, T2, T3, T4: </b> The higher the T number, the larger the tumor and/or the more it may have grown into the primary tissue. <b>The N (lymph node involvement)：N1, N2, N3:</b> The higher the N number, the greater the extent of the lymph node involvement. <b>The M (metastasis): MX</b> means metastasis can't be measured or found. <b>M0</b> means there is no distant metastasis, <b>M1</b> means that distant metastasis is present.
tumor_cell_content	<b>1: </b> tumor cell content in the range 0%-29%; <b>2: </b> tumor cell content in the range 30%-49%; <b>3: </b> tumor cell content in the range 50%-69%; <b>4: </b> tumor cell content in the range 70%-100%.
lymphocyte_content	<b>1: </b> lymphocyte content in the range 0%-29%; <b>2: </b> lymphocyte content in the range 30%-49%; <b>3: </b> lymphocyte content in the range 50%-69%; <b>4: </b> lymphocyte content in the range 70%-100%.
gleason	<b>The Gleason Score</b> The cells identified are given a grade number from 1 to 5, depending on the abnormality of the cells, 1 being the lowest, 5 the highest. The grades of the two most common patterns are added together to give a score (gleason score) from 2 to 10. The higher the score, the more aggressive and fast-growing the cancer. 
grade	<b>Nottingham grade</b> It is a scoring system to define the grade of a breast cancer patient. <b>Grade 1, 2,3: </b> The higher the grade, the more aggressive and fast-growing the cancer. 
pathologic	<b>TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) </b> is a staging system researchers use to provide more details about how the cancer looks and behaves. The TNM system is based on three characteristics: <b>size</b> (<b>T</b> stands for tumor), <b>lymph node involvement</b> (<b>N</b> stands for node) and <b>whether the cancer has metastasized</b> (<b>M</b> stands for metastasis), or moved beyond the primary site to other parts of the body. <b>T1, T2, T3, T4: </b> The higher the T number, the larger the tumor and/or the more it may have grown into the primary tissue. <b>The N (lymph node involvement)：N1, N2, N3: </b> The higher the N number, the greater the extent of the lymph node involvement. <b>The M (metastasis): MX</b> means metastasis can't be measured or found. <b>M0</b> means there is no distant metastasis, <b>M1</b> means that distant metastasis is present.
residual	<b>Residual tumor</b> The tumor status following treatment is described by the residual tumor (R) classification: R0, no residual tumor; R1, microscopic residual tumor; R2, macroscopic residual tumor. RX. Presence of residual tumour cannot be assessed.
stage	<b>TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) </b> is a staging system researchers use to provide more details about how the cancer looks and behaves. The TNM system is based on three characteristics: <b>size</b> (<b>T</b> stands for tumor), <b>lymph node involvement</b> (<b>N</b> stands for node) and <b>whether the cancer has metastasized</b> (<b>M</b> stands for metastasis), or moved beyond the primary site to other parts of the body. <b>T1, T2, T3, T4: </b> The higher the T number, the larger the tumor and/or the more it may have grown into the primary tissue. <b>The N (lymph node involvement)：N1, N2, N3: </b> The higher the N number, the greater the extent of the lymph node involvement. <b>The M (metastasis): MX</b> means metastasis can't be measured or found. <b>M0</b> means there is no distant metastasis, <b>M1</b> means that distant metastasis is present.
tumor_stage	For breast cancer, <b>Stage 0</b> is used to describe non-invasive breast cancers. <b>Stage I</b> describes invasive cancer (cancer cells are breaking through to or invading normal surrounding primary tissue). <b>Stage II</b> is divided into subcategories known as IIA and IIB. <b>Stage IIA</b> describes invasive breast cancer in which: <b>Stage III</b> is divided into subcategories known as IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC. <b>Stage IV</b> describes invasive breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes to other organs of the body.
Fusion_status	The fusion status of ETS family transcription factor gene: <b>ERG, ETS, ETV</b> in prostate cancer. 
status	<b>BCR_status: </b> biochemical recurrence (BCR) or not
subtype	RNA samples were sequenced (paired-end Illumina) and in parallel analyzed on Human HT12 v4 BeadChip microarrays following the manufacturer's standard protocol (Illumina). Intrinsic subtypes were determined for both platforms using the gene lists PAM50, Sorlie and Hu. <b>RNASeq_subtype_hu: </b> subtype defined by Hu gene list based on RNA-seq data; <b>RNASeq_subtype_pam50: </b> subtype defined by PAM50 gene list based on RNA-seq data; <b>RNASeq_subtype_sorlie: </b> subtype defined by Sorlie gene list based on RNA-seq data; <b>ht12_subtype_hu: </b> subtype defined by Hu gene list based on microarray data <b>ht12_subtype_pam50: </b> subtype defined by PAM50 gene list based on microarray data <b>ht12_subtype_sorlie:</b> subtype defined by Sorlie gene list based on microarray data
